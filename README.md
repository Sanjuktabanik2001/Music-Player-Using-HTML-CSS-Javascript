# Music-Player-Using-HTML-CSS-Javascript

In this project I created the front-end design of a music player in HTML, CSS and Javascript.

I have uploaded different files here :-

index.html - It consists of the Home Page's html code of the Music Player.
style.css - It consists of the styling for the html pages in CSS.
script.js - It consists of the functioning javascript code for the index file.
covers and songs -These are files which consists of all the required images and different music files included in the project.

Here I include screenshots of the page:-
